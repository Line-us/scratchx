# Line-us Scratchx Extension

You have stumbled across the Top Secret Line-us Scratch Beta Programme!

We'll be launching our Scratchx extension soon, but of you'd like to try it out before we release it drop us an email at [help@line-us.com](mailto:help@line-us.com) and we'll add you to the testing programme. 

To use Scratch you'll need a firmware update to your Line-us; without it you won't be able to connect. However, if you just want to take a look at what the blocks will look like you can [run our Scratchx extension by clicking here](https://scratchx.org/?url=http://Line-us.github.io/scratchx/Line-us.js#scratch).
