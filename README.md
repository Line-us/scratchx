# Control your Line-us from Scratch

This is the Scratchx extension for Line-us

It's easy and fun to control your Line-us from Scratch. Make sure you have updated your Line-us App to version 2, and upgraded your firmware to version 2.0.3 or later then [run our Scratchx extension by clicking here](http://scratchx.org/?url=http://Line-us.github.io/scratchx/Line-us.js#scratch) to open Scratch in your web browser.

Next, you'll get a big scary warning saying that the extension you're about to load is experimental. If you're feeling brave and want to start your Scratch adventure click I understand, Continue. You'll then see scratch with the custom Line-us blocks. 

Have fun!
